Your AI-Enabled Course Registration System is ready for deployment! Here are the fastest ways to get it live:

## 🌐 Frontend Deployment (Netlify)

### Method 1: Drag & Drop (Easiest)
1. **Build the frontend locally:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```
2. **Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)** and sign up
3. **Drag the `build` folder** to the deploy area
4. **Your site is live!** 🎉

### Method 2: GitHub Integration
1. **Push code to GitHub**
2. **Connect Netlify to your GitHub repo**
3. **Build settings:**
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `build`
   - Base directory: `frontend`

## 🖥️ Backend Deployment (Railway)

### Quick Railway Deployment
1. **Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)**
2. **Sign up with GitHub**
3. **Click "Deploy from GitHub repo"**
4. **Select your repository**
5. **Set root directory to `backend`**
6. **Add environment variables:**
   ```
   NODE_ENV=production
   JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-key-here
   MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-atlas-connection-string
   ```

## 🗄️ Database Setup (MongoDB Atlas)

1. **Go to [mongodb.com/atlas](https://mongodb.com/atlas)**
2. **Create free account and cluster**
3. **Create database user**
4. **Whitelist all IPs (0.0.0.0/0)**
5. **Get connection string**
6. **Run seed script:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   node seedData.js
   ```

## 🔗 Connect Frontend to Backend

After backend is deployed:
1. **Get your Railway backend URL** (e.g., `https://your-app.railway.app`)
2. **Create `.env` file in frontend:**
   ```
   REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-backend-url.railway.app/api
   ```
3. **Rebuild and redeploy frontend**
